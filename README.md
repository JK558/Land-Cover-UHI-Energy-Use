# Land-Cover-UHI-Energy-Use
explore the relationship between Land Surface/Cover and residential energy consumption at granular level using satellite remote sensing info and household survey data, and what it means for urban heat island effect

I use predictive models to find out if having Land Cover information will help better predict individual household's energy consumption level. I also use statistical models(panel regression) to explore the mechanism through which Land Cover could impact energy needs. For details of the analysis, please see my [notebook](https://github.com/JK558/Land-Cover-UHI-Energy-Use/blob/master/Land-Cover-UHI-Energy-Use.ipynb).

Please also check out some visualizations I created for the data using Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/8MTH78S64?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link).
